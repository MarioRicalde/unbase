# Unbase Documentation

The unbase documentation is publicly accessible at https://unba.se/, which is built from this directory with Jekyll.

## Running locally

With Docker installed and inside the `docs` directory, execute the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

Once the container is ready, access the docs locally on port `4000`.
